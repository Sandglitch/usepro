### Project Description

Njan Aan Map is a web app that finds a route between two points in India. The route doesn't have to be shortest route or the most optimal route. It will find a 'route' from point A to point B and that's it.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People need to get from point A to point B

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We get them from point A to point B...eventually
