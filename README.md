### Project Description

Njan Aan Map is a web app that finds a route between two points in India. The route doesn't have to be shortest route or the most optimal route. It will find a 'route' from point A to point B and that's it.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People need to get from point A to point B

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We get them from point A to point B...eventually

### Project Demo
# Video

The video is of the code being run from local host. Then the user enter two locations in one state and watch as a route comically long generates spanning many states and a large waste of time. Truly USELESS!!!

## What we learnt

       We started with an idea for a longest route app and quickly realised we would need a quantum computer for that. Then we set down to brainstorming: how could we make this work. We ran a lot of ideas through ourselves, identifying the pros and cons. This was the most intense ideating session we have had. We learnt a lot, A LOT. We learnt quite a bit about python, pandas and how they are a hassle to work with, how APIs function, how google's cloud console can be navigated and used. We received a lot of help from the mentors and made many connections. I am really proud of making somethingÂ soÂ useless.
